🧭 Project Overview

This project analyzes grocery retail sales and inventory data to optimize 📦 stock availability, 📉 wastage reduction, 📊 demand forecasting, and 💰 profitability improvement.
The solution combines descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics to improve inventory planning and reduce revenue leakage caused by stockouts and overstocking.

🎯 Business Objectives
✔️ Monitor sales and inventory performance using key KPIs
✔️ Identify stockout and expiry risk patterns
✔️ Analyze seasonal and festival-driven demand variability
✔️ Build a demand forecasting model for better reorder decisions
✔️ Optimize inventory levels to balance availability and wastage
